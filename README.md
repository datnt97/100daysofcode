# 100 Days of Code - C# and .NET Learning

Welcome to my "100 Days of Code" repository! In this project, I am on a journey to learn and improve my skills in C# and .NET by dedicating 100 days to code, explore, and build various projects. This repository serves as a logbook for my progress and a place to share what I learn along the way.

## What is 100 Days of Code?

[100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is a popular challenge in the developer community. The idea is to code consistently for 100 days, improving your skills and knowledge, and tracking your progress.

## Goals

My primary goals for this challenge are:

- [Master C# fundamentals, Learn ASP.NET Core, Build a CRUD application, etc.]
- Make code as hobby.

## Resources

## Getting Involved

If you have any suggestions, advice, or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me. I'm always open to learning from others and sharing knowledge.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
